MY PORTFOLIO

ADVENTURE GAME

this was a midterm project for my programming course in which I needed to create 6 unique classes with properites and functions. My game is called Water Quest! in it you defend your water suply from invaders by interacting with a random enemy input and reacting to it with your owm. You must hold, attack or defend to outsmart the randomized enemy.


MADLIB

This project was one of the first I completed in C#. Making a madlib is an excellent method to learn basic programming ideas. The software will prompt the user to enter words, save them, and then use them to change words in a quotation, tale, or other brief piece of text that will be written to the terminal window. Because the random words are often amusing when incorporated, it can be entertaining to play once it is constructed. It was great startingÂ Â with a console application so that IÂ couldÂ concentrate on programming ideas and C# fundamentals.


CALCULATOR

This calculator was also a project that I worked on during my programming 101 class oh, it was an introduction to functions and integers and was a great way to start off learning these Concepts and how they interact. the calculator can take two numbers and apply one of the four basic forms of arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)


NUMBER GUESSING GAME

In this game I learned about randomized inputs in C# I learned alot in Programming 101 but this is what inspired my midterm project the Adventure game you see above.
